# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Add weekly stable and non-blocking Insiders compatibility lanes, a reproducible headless Docker runner, retained extension-host failure logs, and Corepack-only pnpm resolution.
- Apply Debug Recorder auto-tracking and editor-decoration setting changes without reloading VS Code, including initial-editor and document-edit refreshes.
- Preserve typed audit targets while sanitizing field injection and dispose the audit channel with the extension lifecycle.
- Honor Language Model Tool health refresh controls through the shared HealthStore and return deterministic, parseable JSON with explicit omission metadata.
- Track concurrent VS Code debug sessions through their matching Debug Recorder session IDs and close each mapped session exactly once on termination or extension shutdown.
- Apply `orbit.debug.maxSessionsShown` after deterministic sorting and restrict the `Recent (7 days)` group to sessions updated within that window.
- Align Agent Card validation with the A2A 1.0 ProtoJSON model, including security scheme wrappers, canonical security requirements, and `capabilities.extendedAgentCard`.
- Normalize supported pre-1.0 security scheme and `security` requirement shapes into the canonical runtime model before rendering or exposing them through Language Model Tools.

### Security

- Remove legacy plaintext token settings from every configuration scope even when SecretStorage already contains the authoritative token.
- Add repository-specific Renovate best-practices policy, strict config validation, GitHub Action digest tracking, vulnerability-alert handling, and weekly manual lockfile maintenance.
- Add tokenless Semgrep CE scanning in pre-commit and GitHub Actions, document the existing SonarCloud and Snyk GitHub App checks, and provide an optional manual Snyk pre-commit hook.
- Pin all GitHub Actions to immutable commit SHAs with Renovate-readable version comments.
- Harden untrusted Agent Card discovery with bounded manual redirects, DNS address policy checks, IP-pinned HTTPS connections, and a streaming 256 KiB response limit.
- Report blocked discovery policy outcomes without exposing URL credentials or query values in audit output.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- Exclude local pnpm store and maintainer-only dotfiles from packaged VSIX artifacts.
- Add packaged-extension smoke coverage for forbidden local and maintainer-only files.
- Add repository line-ending attributes so Windows local verification matches CI formatting.
- Dispose test-created TreeViews in the extension-host suite.
- Align release documentation and workflow permissions with the current non-attestation release flow.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Fleet standards configs: `.npmrc`, `.github/dependabot.yml`, `.commitlintrc.json`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- Org-only guard (`github.repository_owner == 'oaslananka'`) on all CI/CD workflow jobs.
- `.prettierignore` for cleaner formatting output.

### Changed

- Migrated `renovate.json` to `config:recommended` with rate limits, auto-merge for patches and devDependencies.
- Updated `@vscode/vsce` to 3.9.2, `prettier` to 3.8.4, `@typescript-eslint/*` to 8.61.0, `concurrently` to 10.0.3, `ovsx` to 1.0.0.
- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` to reference Taskfile commands.

### Fixed

- Harden CI/CD release workflow with merge-base verification and create-or-update release support.
- Health provider error handling, race conditions, and debounce disposal.
- Added `escapeHtml` utility for proper XSS prevention in webviews.
- Improved test infrastructure with `cleanGenerated.mjs` and new contract tests.

### Removed

## [0.5.2] - 2026-06-02
