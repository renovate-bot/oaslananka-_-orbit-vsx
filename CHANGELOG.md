# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.7] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- Exclude local pnpm store and maintainer-only dotfiles from packaged VSIX artifacts.
- Add packaged-extension smoke coverage for forbidden local and maintainer-only files.

### Added

- Fleet standards configs: `.npmrc`, `.github/dependabot.yml`, `.commitlintrc.json`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- Org-only guard (`github.repository_owner == 'oaslananka'`) on all CI/CD workflow jobs.
- `.prettierignore` for cleaner formatting output.

### Changed

- Migrated `renovate.json` to `config:recommended` with rate limits, auto-merge for patches and devDependencies.

### Fixed

- Added `escapeHtml` utility for proper XSS prevention in webviews.
